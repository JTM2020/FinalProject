# FinalProject
Final Project Directions

1. Open Matlab and enter in the command window finalProject1
2. My User Interface named Baseball Hitting Statistics should open up
3. Now you'll enter your batters inputs including their outs, singles, doubles, triples, homeruns, and Walks/HBP
4. The push buttons on the left of the screen will have each of these labels
5. By pressing outs button you will have added one at bat which will be displayed in the middle of the screen
6. By pressing the buttons for singles, doubles, triples, and homeruns these will add to the hits display as well as at bats in the middle of the screen
7. In the case of a Walk or Hit By Pitch by pressing the Walks/HBP you will add to the Walks/HBP display at the beginning of the screen
8. All inputs that need to be entered are your batters outs, singles, doubles, triples, homeruns, and Walks/HBP
9. Once these are all entered you can now use the top four bottoms on the left side of the screen which will calculate Batting Average, On Base Percentage, Slugging, and On Base Percentage plus Slugging
10. To calculate those values press those top four buttons that are properly labeled and your batters stats should be diplayed in the middle of the screen along with your at bats, hits, and Walks/HBP
11. To reset your inputs there is a reset button on the right side of the screen which will reset all your values to zero so that you can calculate for another player.
12. Now the bottom right of the screen has an edit box for you to input your player number 
13. This edit box is only formatted for numerical input so it will give you an error message if you use any non numerical characters
14. There is also radio buttons to select if they are the home or away team so select which team your player is on
15. Once you have selected your players number in the edit box and selected their team you can now press the enter button that is right next to the player number edit box
16. This enter button will activate a message box that wil display your players number, team, and their stats that you have just calculated
17. It will also create a csv file that will have your players number along with the stats that were just calculated
18. This feature is unneccesary if you want to just use the stat calculator but if you want to actually track your player's stats this feature comes in handy
20. Then once done you can press the close button which will then close the user interface
